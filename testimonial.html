        <p>  In our first YouTube video, we encountered a number of difficulties and challenges,
            which were unfortunately reflected in the video's output. We admit that we bit off more
            than we could chew because our concept for a first video, a Beginner's Guide to Mobile Legends,
            was far more challenging than we had anticipated because it needed to cover a lot of ground.
            There was a lot of complicated editing going on, which I was very proud of because it turned out really well.
            However, when the time came to upload our video, we discovered that it had a large watermark in it.
            because of the editing app I used and in the process of attempting to erase it, I managed to erase 70% of the video,
            which I didn't realize until two weeks after the deadline. 
            This really set us back, We learned from this that we should not make our videos too long as  they will be tedious to make and watch.</p>

        <p>I found it extremely difficult to record our first video.
            The progress for our first video has indeed been slow
            because we have very little experience planning YouTube content
            and have no idea what will cause our video to go viral.</p>

        <p>Upon making our first video, my body was circulating with excitement and when we did the gameplay,
          it was fun and entertaining at the same time though we did face challenges that caused a great deal of panic
          and stress to the group but still it was worth it as we learned a lot from this experience even with all the downfalls.</p>

        <p>For our first video, I can say that our work was not the best
          but I already expected it because it is our first time making a youtube video and we did our best.
          I was and am still grateful for the expereince that it gave us as this was our first steps
          to truly gaining the knowlege and understanding in how to be content creators</p>

        <p>Our progress was smooth when creating our second video because we now know what we need and don't need to do.
          I believe that being able to see our analytics was extremely beneficial to us when creating our second video
          because it allowed us to see what our audience desired and learning about SEO aided our group in uploading
          our content with confidence that it would receive a large number of views,
          as it taught us various strategies that could cause our video to go viral.</p>

          <p>For our second video, we used the experiences that we gained from previous works.
            It is much better and we improved on the different aspects that we were lacking during the first video. I was the editor for the second video
            and I'm proud of what our output has came to be.</p>

        <p> Coding is still difficult for me, even after two quarters of learning it,
            but we did our absolute best to finish our website within the deadline,
            but coding is time-consuming and there was only 4 days notice to complete the website as well as other outputs,
            I had to pull a lot of all-nighters to manage the extreme time pressure.
            It was a great learning experience as i knew I still needed to practice a lot befoere being able to code with speed and accuracy.</p>

          <p>Upon making the website, I learned more about creating a website
            like embedding a video wo the website and more. It was enlightening for me
            to realize that I still have a lot to learn with coding especially with css and javascript.
